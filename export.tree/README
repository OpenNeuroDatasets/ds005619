ABSTRACT
[18F]SF51 is a novel radioligand for imaging translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) that previously displayed excellent imaging properties in nonhuman primates. This study assessed its performance in human brain and its dosimetry. Seven healthy participants underwent brain PET imaging to measure TSPO binding using a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) to calculate total distribution volume (VT). This cohort included two high-affinity binders (HABs), three mixed-affinity binders (MABs), and two low-affinity binders (LABs). Two other participants received whole-body scans to assess radiation exposure. Peak brain radioactivity reached an SUV of 1.4 at 3 minutes post-injection, diminishing to 30% of peak by 120 minutes. The average VT for all genotype groups was notably low (<1mL∙cm-3), emphasizing the radioligand’s poor binding in brain. [18F]SF51 remained sensitive to the TSPO polymorphism in vivo, as shown by a two-fold difference in VT between HABs and LABs. VT stabilization by 80 minutes post-injection suggested minimal radiometabolite accumulation in brain. The average effective dose was 13.8±0.9 µSv/MBq. Contrary to previously published animal data, [18F]SF51 showed low binding to human TSPO, with uptake remaining influenced by the rs6971 polymorphism. These findings highlight the challenges of developing TSPO radioligands and underscore the significant species differences that may influence translational outcomes.
